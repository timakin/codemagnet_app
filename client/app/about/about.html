          Sure! But each code should include the:<br/><br/>
          
          ・Title: simply summarized description about code.<br/>
          ・Url: Direct link to code (avoid unreadable code, like whole repository)<br/>
          ・Language: With which language the code is written<br/>
          ・Introduction: (How to use, Why is the code awesome, the logical relationship with other methods or modules.)<br/><br/>

          Examples:<br/><br/>

          ・Title: <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher/blob/5e491d7211b0f77d03befd842ca5d6bd44ad244c/src/util.c#L140">High speed search with ag</a><br/>
          ・Language: <a class="txtNavy">C</a><br/>
          ・Introduction:<br/>
           <p>The substitute of grep command, "ag" is super quick to search. BM algorithm is the reason. Boyer-Moore String Search Algorithm is an efficient string searching. The key feature of the algorithm is to match on the tail of the pattern rather than the head, and to skip along the text in jumps of multiple characters rather than searching every single character in the text. </p>
